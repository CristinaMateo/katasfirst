Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.


let herFlower = Math.floor(Math.random ()*20)
let hisFlower = Math.floor(Math.random ()*20)

console.log('She got a flower with ' + herFlower + ' petals.')
console.log( 'He got a flower with ' + hisFlower + ' petals.')


const inLove = function(herFlower,hisFlower) {
  return (herFlower%2) !== (hisFlower%2)
}

inLove (herFlower,hisFlower) ? console.log('They are in love.') : console.log('They are not in love.')
